On one hand, it is a club on campus that gives me access to a bunch of useful resources that could be helpful in the long run. Additionally, the experience I can get from the club would serve as a great stepping stone for my career. On the other hand, I subconsciously just characterize it as just another club on campus; I can always find the resources it offers through otherways, like cold emailing. I understand the potential benefits, but my brain is telling me to just take it easy and relax. I think what I will end up doing is to try my best for the interview, but go in with the mindset that a rejection will not really mean anything in the future."
