She presented into the emergency room last week after having severe stomach pain, on and off. After conducting a biopsy, it was determined that she has gastric cancer. The good thing is that it is in a very early stage, so treatment should be fairly simple. Fingers crossed, if the doctors decide to use chemotherapy as a solution, therapy goes well. I guess the good way to think about this issue is that the cancer was detected at an early stage. But it still really sucks to think about my mom having a near-incurable disease. The doctors predict a smooth recovery, so I am praying for that."
