I usually procrastinate until a day before the deadline to do most of my stuff, but this time I wanted to change up my lifestyle. Additionally, I got back my midterm 2 for my life science 7c class; I got an A! I was super stressed about this, because it ended up being a really hard test for me. There was a lot of stuff to study on, so I felt paranoid if I was really covering everything. At least it went well, and my studying paid off. I also adopted a new studying technique this time, so maybe that also contributed to my success for this test. Maybe I will continue using this method to get good scores."
